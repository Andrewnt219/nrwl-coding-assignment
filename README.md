# Submission's note

I also fix a bug in tickets and users controllers as the routes are not handled. See commit [b1d3e77](https://github.com/Andrewnt219/nrwl-coding-assignment/commit/b1d3e776b7d99798fab3c2101893ecc60004578c)

Estimation:

- App: < 2 hours
- Test: ~1 hour. I was not familiar with setting up tests from scratch, so it took a while.
- Stackblitz: < 10 mins
